    <p></p>
    My interest in photography blossomed in middle school, and the desire to
    pursue it for a lifetime took root in my heart. The journey began with
    joining the yearbook team, participating in visual arts competitions, and
    hosting small exhibitions during my high school years. I also applied for an
    internship to a professional studio that equipped me with valuable insights
    into the intricacies of commercial photography, where I gained hands-on
    expertise in utilizing various lighting techniques, mastering the use of
    photography gear, and refining post-production skills through applications
    like Photoshop. The pivotal moment came when I was accepted into CalArts,
    solidifying my commitment to dive into the art industry.
